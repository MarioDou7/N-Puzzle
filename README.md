# N-Puzzle
Creating an Algorithm to Solve the N-puzzle 
Applying A* search algorithm and using priority function for a state (Heuristic 
value) the script will search for the goal state based on the following two functions
(Hamming priority Function) (Manhatten priority Function)

implementing priority queue and closedlist 

and acheiving complexity of the solve function O(E log V) where E is the number of all the steps the script tried and the 
V is the number of elements in the priority queue
